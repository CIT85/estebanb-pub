        <h1>What are my goals? That's an excellent question.</h1>
        <hr>
        <h3>So let me go ahead and answer that.</h3>
        <p>
            There are, of course, more broad goals that I have. I want to finish getting my education, I want to get married, and I want to start a family. My girlfriend and I are both 21 years old and we've been together for two years. My goal for marriage is to be married by 24. I also want to land a job as a high school teacher, preferably math although I have recently been looking into computer science, hence the reason why I'm taking this course.
            <br>
            Those were more <em>broad</em> goals but I do have <strong>short term</strong> goals. First and foremost, I'd like to deepen my relationship with God. Every day is a day to be renewed in God's image and I try to take every day as it comes. In my eyes, nothing can be achieved without God. I would want my marriage to be a fruitful one. I would like my education and career to be aligned with God's teaching. So I try to have my first goal of each day to be a child of God although I'm not perfect and each day is a struggle. Beyond that primary goal, I'd like to finish this assignment, pass this course, pass all of my courses, and then pass my next semester and so on and so forth taking everything day by day.
